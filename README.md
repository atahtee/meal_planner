### -The Meal Planner autoselects a meal for a user after they have chosen the number of calories that they would love to take. 

#### -There are also separate diet plans according to users suitability eg if a user is a vegan, the app will recommend a different set of diet compared to low-carb diets or paleo. One can select the number of meals that he/she intends to eat and the app divides the number of calories with the number selected to ensure healthier living.
